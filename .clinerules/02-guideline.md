## Markdown & HTML Guidelines

- Use standard Markdown syntax with GFM extensions enabled.
- Ensure headings have unique IDs for anchor-link generation.
- Anchor links next to headings appear only on hover.

## Code Comment Guidelines

- Avoid commenting on obvious code; good code should be self-explanatory.
- Use comments to explain why code is written in a certain way, especially if it may seem unusual.
- Document known issues, edge cases, or assumptions explicitly (e.g., using TODO, FIXME, or HACK).
- Provide high-level context or summaries to help readers understand complex code blocks.
- Always anticipate what future readers might find confusing, and proactively clarify those points with comments.
